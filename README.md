# myFtp

Welcome on my project ftp for Efrei

## How to use

When you will start the project you have 2 option

- Log in with command `USER` (you will find existing users in './src/user.json')

``` USER [username] ```

- Create an user and a password with command `CREATEUSER` 

``` CREATEUSER [username] [password] ```

When this is done you can use the command `HELP` to see every other command possible

Have fun !
